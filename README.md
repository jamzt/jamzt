I am Jamie from Chicago. Originally, Central Asia, then South East Asia, California, Washington and now Illinois. I have a background in finance, accounting, investment. I love learning new skills, languages, frameworks and seeing where technology is headed. I got interested in Python and its use in Finance. Then I decided to become a software engineer and after earning the certification in Full Stack Engineering and doing an internship as a developer. I have realized I enjoy this career path better and find it more fulfilling. I love autonomy, problem-solving, working with data, development and design. Check out my portfolio and the dental clinic website I've built recently.  Excited for this journey!
