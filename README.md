### Hi there 👋, Jamie Taalai
#### Full Stack Development

I come from a background in finance, accounting, and investing. Along the way, I got curious about Python and its applications in finance — and that curiosity turned into a passion for software engineering. After completing a Full Stack Engineering certification and interning as a developer, I realized this path felt not only more fulfilling but aligned with how I love to work: with autonomy, creativity, and real-world problem-solving.
I love building tools that combine data, design, and impact and require systems-thinking. Recent project I am  really excited about is:

Lytheon, is an AI-powered valuation platform that parses real-time financial and macroeconomic data (from SEC, FRED, Yahoo Finance), applies ARIMA forecasting, and dynamically selects valuation models (DCF, GGM, and my custom method) based on multi-dimensional company drivers.

I also used natural language processing (NLP) model in analyzing financial sentiment, earnings call transcripts, and behavioral biases and trends.

## Skills and Experience:
* ⚛️ React
* ⠻ SQL, R
* 💻 HTML, CCS, SCCS, JavaScript, Python, Java(learning)


## What's new:
- 🔭 I am currently exploring LLM, especially in finance
- 🔭 Improving the front end of Lytheon, switicnhing from StreamLit prototype to React
